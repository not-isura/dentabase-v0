# Appointment Dismiss Feature

## Problem Identified
When implementing the completed appointment UI with "Book New Appointment" and "Dismiss" buttons, we encountered a looping issue:

1. ✅ Completed appointments were showing on the page
2. ✅ User could click "Dismiss" button
3. ❌ On page refresh, the dismissed appointment would reload back

**Root Cause:** The query was fetching all completed appointments without any way to track if they had been dismissed by the user.

## Solution: `is_active` Column

Added a boolean column `is_active` to the `appointments` table to track whether an appointment should be visible to the user.

### Database Migration

**File:** `ADD-IS-ACTIVE-COLUMN-MIGRATION.sql`

```sql
-- Add the is_active column with default value true
ALTER TABLE appointments 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true NOT NULL;

-- Set existing appointments to active
UPDATE appointments 
SET is_active = true 
WHERE is_active IS NULL;

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_appointments_is_active 
ON appointments(is_active);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_appointments_patient_active_status 
ON appointments(patient_id, is_active, status);
```

### How to Run the Migration

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `ADD-IS-ACTIVE-COLUMN-MIGRATION.sql`
3. Paste and run the migration
4. Verify with:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'appointments' AND column_name = 'is_active';
```

## Code Changes

### 1. Updated Query Filter
**Location:** `src/app/(dashboard)/appointments/patient/page.tsx` (line ~899)

**Before:**
```typescript
.eq('patient_id', patientData.patient_id)
.in('status', ['requested', 'proposed', 'booked', 'arrived', 'ongoing', 'completed'])
```

**After:**
```typescript
.eq('patient_id', patientData.patient_id)
.eq('is_active', true)  // ← Added this filter
.in('status', ['requested', 'proposed', 'booked', 'arrived', 'ongoing', 'completed'])
```

### 2. Implemented Dismiss Functionality
**Location:** `src/app/(dashboard)/appointments/patient/page.tsx` (line ~629)

**Before:**
```typescript
onClick={async () => {
  try {
    // Just hide it from the UI by refreshing - it will be filtered by the query
    window.location.reload();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error dismissing:', error);
  }
}}
```

**After:**
```typescript
onClick={async () => {
  try {
    const supabase = createClient();
    
    // Set is_active to false to dismiss the appointment
    const { error } = await supabase
      .from('appointments')
      .update({ is_active: false })
      .eq('appointment_id', appointmentId);
    
    if (error) {
      console.error('Error dismissing appointment:', error);
      return;
    }
    
    // Refresh to remove from UI
    window.location.reload();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error dismissing:', error);
  }
}}
```

## User Flow

### Complete Appointment Lifecycle

1. **Requested** → User books appointment
   - `is_active = true`
   - Shows in UI with status badge and actions

2. **Proposed** → Clinic suggests alternative time
   - `is_active = true`
   - Shows "Proposed Time" card with Confirm button

3. **Booked** → Appointment confirmed
   - `is_active = true`
   - Shows "Mark as Arrived" button

4. **Arrived** → Patient checks in
   - `is_active = true`
   - Shows "Start Consultation" button

5. **Ongoing** → Consultation in progress
   - `is_active = true`
   - Shows "Complete Appointment" button

6. **Completed** → Appointment finished
   - `is_active = true` ✅ Still visible
   - Shows "Book New Appointment" + "Dismiss" buttons
   - User can review the completed appointment details

7. **Dismissed** → User hides from view
   - `is_active = false` 🚫 No longer fetched
   - Appointment removed from UI
   - Data preserved in database for history/records

### Alternative Paths

- **Cancelled** (by patient)
  - `is_active = true` initially
  - Remains visible until dismissed
  
- **Rejected** (by clinic)
  - `is_active = true` initially
  - Remains visible until dismissed

## Benefits

✅ **No Data Loss:** Appointments are never deleted, only hidden
✅ **User Control:** Patient decides when to dismiss completed appointments
✅ **Clean UI:** Dismissed appointments don't clutter the interface
✅ **Audit Trail:** All appointment data preserved for reporting/history
✅ **Performance:** Indexed queries are fast even with many appointments

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run the database migration successfully
- [ ] Create a new appointment (verify `is_active = true` by default)
- [ ] Progress appointment through all statuses
- [ ] Complete the appointment (verify it stays visible with both buttons)
- [ ] Click "Dismiss" button
- [ ] Verify appointment disappears from UI
- [ ] Check database: appointment should have `is_active = false`
- [ ] Refresh page multiple times (verify dismissed appointment doesn't reappear)
- [ ] Create another appointment to ensure the dismiss didn't affect new bookings

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- **View Dismissed:** Button to show dismissed/archived appointments
- **Reactivate:** Allow user to restore dismissed appointments to active view
- **Auto-dismiss:** Automatically dismiss completed appointments after X days
- **Bulk Actions:** Dismiss multiple completed appointments at once
