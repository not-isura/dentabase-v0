# Email Verification Error Message - Custom Handling

## What Was Changed

The "Email not confirmed" error now shows a **user-friendly message** with the ability to **resend the verification email**.

## Changes Made

### 1. Custom Error Message
**Old message (from Supabase):**
```
Email not confirmed
```

**New message:**
```
Please verify your email address. Check your inbox for a verification link, or click 'Resend verification email' below.
```

### 2. Resend Verification Button
When the user tries to log in with an unverified email, a button appears that allows them to resend the verification email without leaving the login page.

### 3. Code Changes in `login/page.tsx`

**Added state for resend functionality:**
```typescript
const [showResendVerification, setShowResendVerification] = useState(false);
const [isResending, setIsResending] = useState(false);
```

**Added error detection:**
```typescript
if (authError.message.toLowerCase().includes('email not confirmed')) {
  setShowResendVerification(true);
  throw new Error(
    "Please verify your email address. Check your inbox for a verification link, or click 'Resend verification email' below."
  );
}
```

**Added resend function:**
```typescript
const handleResendVerification = async () => {
  // Validates email is entered
  // Calls supabase.auth.resend() with type: 'signup'
  // Shows success message
  // Hides the resend button after success
}
```

**Added UI button:**
```tsx
{showResendVerification && (
  <Button
    onClick={handleResendVerification}
    disabled={isResending}
  >
    {isResending ? "Sending..." : "Resend Verification Email"}
  </Button>
)}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: User tries to login with unverified email

1. User enters email and password
2. Clicks "Sign In"
3. Sees error message: **"Please verify your email address. Check your inbox for a verification link, or click 'Resend verification email' below."**
4. Sees **"Resend Verification Email"** button
5. Clicks button
6. Sees success message: **"Verification email sent! Please check your inbox."**
7. Checks email and clicks verification link
8. Returns to login page and signs in successfully ✅

### Scenario 2: User already verified email

1. User enters email and password
2. Clicks "Sign In"
3. Logs in successfully → Redirected to dashboard ✅

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Unverified Email Login
1. Register a new account (email verification enabled)
2. Don't verify the email yet
3. Try to log in with the new account
4. Expected: Custom error message + Resend button appears

### Test Case 2: Resend Verification
1. After seeing the error, click "Resend Verification Email"
2. Expected: Button shows "Sending..." then success message appears
3. Check email inbox for new verification email
4. Click verification link
5. Try logging in again
6. Expected: Login succeeds

### Test Case 3: Already Verified Email
1. Log in with a verified account (e.g., patient1@test.com)
2. Expected: Login succeeds, no error

## Error Message Customization

If you want to change the error message further, edit this line in `login/page.tsx`:

```typescript
throw new Error(
  "Please verify your email address. Check your inbox for a verification link, or click 'Resend verification email' below."
);
```

**Other message ideas:**
- `"Your email address hasn't been verified yet. Please check your inbox for a verification email."`
- `"Account not verified. Please verify your email before logging in."`
- `"Email verification required. Click the link in your verification email to activate your account."`

## Additional Customization Options

### Option 1: Auto-resend on error
Add this after detecting the error:
```typescript
if (authError.message.toLowerCase().includes('email not confirmed')) {
  setShowResendVerification(true);
  // Auto-resend verification email
  await handleResendVerification();
  throw new Error("We've sent a new verification email. Please check your inbox.");
}
```

### Option 2: Show verification status on hover
Add tooltip to the error message explaining what email verification means.

### Option 3: Add a link to spam folder reminder
```typescript
throw new Error(
  "Please verify your email address. Check your inbox (and spam folder) for a verification link."
);
```

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Failed to resend verification email"
**Cause:** Supabase rate limiting or email service configuration
**Fix:** Wait a few minutes before trying again, or check Supabase email settings

### Issue 2: Resend button doesn't appear
**Cause:** Error message doesn't match "email not confirmed"
**Fix:** Check console logs for the actual error message and update the condition

### Issue 3: Verification email not received
**Cause:** Email service configuration, spam folder, or invalid email
**Fix:** 
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify email service is configured in Supabase dashboard
- Check Supabase logs for email delivery status

## Next Steps

Once users can verify their emails and log in:
1. ✅ Test the complete registration → verification → login flow
2. ✅ Ensure verified users can access protected routes
3. ✅ Move on to building the Profile Page

## Summary

The error message is now much more **user-friendly** and **actionable**:
- ✅ Clear explanation of what went wrong
- ✅ Action button to fix the issue (resend verification)
- ✅ Success feedback when verification email is sent
- ✅ Better UX overall - users don't need to re-register or contact support
