# 🧪 Route Protection Testing Guide - Layout-Based

## What You Should See:

### ✅ Test 1: Access Protected Route WITHOUT Login

**Steps:**
1. **Make sure you're logged out** (click Sign Out if needed)
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

**Expected Behavior:**
1. ⏳ **Brief loading spinner** appears (purple spinning circle with "Checking authentication...")
2. ⚡ **Instant redirect** to `/login`
3. ❌ **You NEVER see the dashboard** - not even for a split second

**Why this happens:**
- `RouteGuard` runs on the server BEFORE the page renders
- Checks authentication
- No user found → redirects immediately
- Browser receives redirect response before any dashboard HTML

---

### ✅ Test 2: Access Login Page WHILE Logged In

**Steps:**
1. **Login first** with `patient1@test.com` / `Test123!`
2. After redirect to dashboard, manually type in browser: `http://localhost:3000/login`

**Expected Behavior:**
1. ⏳ **Brief loading spinner** appears
2. ⚡ **Instant redirect** back to `/dashboard`
3. ❌ **You NEVER see the login page**

**Why this happens:**
- `AuthGuard` checks if user is already authenticated
- User found → redirects to dashboard
- Prevents logging in again when already logged in

---

### ✅ Test 3: Normal Dashboard Access (Logged In)

**Steps:**
1. **Login** with `patient1@test.com` / `Test123!`
2. Should automatically redirect to `/dashboard`
3. Dashboard loads normally

**Expected Behavior:**
1. ⏳ **Brief loading spinner** (very quick, might not even see it)
2. ✅ **Dashboard loads fully**
3. ✅ **Sidebar, navbar, content all visible**
4. ✅ **Can navigate to other pages** (Appointments, Settings, etc.)

**Why this happens:**
- `RouteGuard` checks auth
- User found → allows access
- Page renders normally

---

### ✅ Test 4: Logout and Re-access Dashboard

**Steps:**
1. **While logged in**, click profile dropdown (top-right)
2. Click "Sign Out"
3. Should redirect to `/login`
4. Now try to visit: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

**Expected Behavior:**
1. ⏳ **Loading spinner**
2. ⚡ **Redirects to `/login`**
3. ❌ **Cannot access dashboard anymore**

**Why this happens:**
- Logout clears auth session/cookies
- `RouteGuard` now finds no user
- Protection kicks in again

---

### ✅ Test 5: All Protected Routes

**Steps:**
Try visiting these URLs **without login**:
- `/dashboard`
- `/appointments`
- `/patients`
- `/records`
- `/settings`
- `/profile`
- `/notifications`

**Expected Behavior:**
- ⚡ **ALL of them redirect to `/login`**
- ❌ **None of them load** without authentication

**Why:**
- All are under `(dashboard)` route group
- All wrapped by same `RouteGuard`
- Single point of protection for all dashboard routes

---

### ✅ Test 6: Register Page (Public Route)

**Steps:**
1. **Logged out**, visit: `http://localhost:3000/register`

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ **Page loads normally**
- ✅ **No redirect** (register is public)

**Then:**
1. **Login** with test account
2. Try to visit `/register` again

**Expected Behavior:**
- ⚡ **Redirects to `/dashboard`**
- ❌ **Can't see register page when logged in**

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria:

✅ **Protection is working if:**
1. Cannot access any dashboard route when logged out
2. Redirects are instant (no page flash)
3. Loading spinner appears briefly during auth check
4. Can access dashboard pages when logged in
5. Cannot access login/register when already logged in
6. After logout, dashboard becomes inaccessible again

❌ **Protection is NOT working if:**
1. You see dashboard content before redirect
2. Can access dashboard without login
3. No redirect happens at all
4. Page loads then redirects (should redirect BEFORE page loads)

---

## 🔍 Debugging:

### If Test 1 Fails (Can access dashboard without login):
**Check:**
1. Is `RouteGuard` imported in dashboard layout?
2. Did server restart after adding RouteGuard?
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### If Loading Spinner Doesn't Appear:
**This is OK!** 
- Server might be very fast
- Spinner only shows during auth check
- If redirect is instant, you might not see it

### If Redirect Loops (Keeps redirecting back and forth):
**Check:**
1. Are you logged in or out? (Clear cookies)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify `.env.local` has correct Supabase keys

## 📝 Report Back:

After testing, tell me:
1. ✅ **Which tests passed?** (1-6)
2. ❌ **Which tests failed?** (if any)
3. 🤔 **Any unexpected behavior?**
4. 👀 **Did you see the loading spinner?** (Brief purple spinner)

Then we'll add the remaining bonus features! 🚀

## 💡 Pro Tip:

Use **two browser windows** side by side:
- Window 1: Logged in (dashboard works)
- Window 2: Incognito (not logged in, dashboard blocked)

This makes testing much easier!
