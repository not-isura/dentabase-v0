## üìã Recommended Next Steps

**Why:** Make sure profile page works while groupmate tests registration

**Steps:**
1. Log in with an existing test account (patient1@test.com, password: Test123!)
2. Navigate to `/profile` or click profile icon in navbar
3. Click "Edit Profile" button

### Option 2: Update Navbar with Real User Data (Recommended - 10 minutes)
**Why:** Right now navbar shows hardcoded "Dr. Sarah Wilson". Should show actual logged-in user's name.

**What to Do:**
I can help you:
1. Create a User Context Provider
2. Fetch user data on app load
3. Update navbar to display: "FirstName LastName" and role
4. Show loading state while fetching

**Expected Time:** 10-15 minutes with my help

### Option 3: Wait for Groupmate's Feedback (No Action Needed)
**Why:** Let groupmate complete testing before moving forward

**What to Do:**
- Wait for feedback on registration page
- Fix any issues they find
- Then test profile page together

**Expected Time:** Depends on groupmate's availability

---

### Option 4: Fix Registration RLS Issues (If Groupmate Reports Errors)
**Why:** If groupmate encounters RLS errors during registration

**What to Do:**
1. Ask groupmate for specific error message
2. Check if they ran the SQL from `FIX-REGISTRATION-RLS-FINAL.sql`
3. Verify the database function `create_user_profile()` exists
4. Test registration yourself to reproduce issue

**Expected Time:** 5-20 minutes depending on issue
